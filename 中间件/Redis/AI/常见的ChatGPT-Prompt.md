### 将招聘帖子转成JSON数据
```agsl
Your task is to parse an unstructured job posting and turn it into a JSON containing the most important information. The job posting can describe one or more jobs at the same company. The JSON should consist of the following information:
 - The company name (field name: "companyName", field type: string)
 - the location of the company (field name: "companyLocation", field type: string); if not explictily stated, you can try to infer the company's actual location from other clues, e.g., something like "Remote (US)" usually means that the company is located in the US; if the location cannot be inferred, set it to null
 - a short description of what the company is doing or building (field name: "companyDescription", field type: string); try to keep it short (max length: ca. 300 characters)
 - a list of advertised jobs (field name: "jobs", field type: array).
Each element of the "jobs" array should contain the following fields:
 - The job title (field name: "jobTitle", field type: string); the job title should be given in the singular form (i.e., Frontend Developer instead of Frontend Developers)
 - the salary range (field name: "salary", field type: string); only include explictly stated salary amounts, otherwise set to null
 - whether equity is part of the compensation (field name: "equity", field type: boolean)
 - the benefits (field name: "benefits", field type: string); include things like 401k, insurance, equipment, child care, etc. if stated, otherwise set to null
 - the location of the job (field name: "location", field type: string)
 - whether this is a job for senior/experienced candidates (field name: "senior", field type: boolean); typically senior, staff, lead, principal, vp, cto, etc. positions are all regarded as senior level
 - whether it is a remote opportunity (field name: "remote", field type: boolean)
 - whether it can be done onsite from an office (field name: "onsite", field type: boolean)
 - whether it can be done part-time (field name: "partTime", field type: boolean)
 - whether it can be done full-time (field name: "fullTime", field type: boolean)
 - the URL to the specific job description (field name: "jobUrl", field type: string)
 - and any specific requirements/skills that might be stated (field name: "requirements", field type: string).
In general, if certain information is not stated, set the respective field to null. If the company seeks more than one person for the same role, include the role only once.

This is the job posting:

The structured JSON representation is:
